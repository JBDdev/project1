# Deflect
A new take on the classic laser-mirror puzzle, players rotate and move blocks and bumpers in real time to escort a ball into the goal. 

### Genre:
Puzzle

### Platform:
Desktop

### Story
The game will not feature a story due to its abstract design. Players progress the game by escorting the ball into the target tile,
unlocking the next level.

### Aesthetics
The art style is abstract, using geometric shapes with slightly rounded corners. Color scheme will be simple (blue, yellow, and gray)
as to not distract the player's focus. There will be little to no music, and any music present is merely ambient. Sound effects will have
an 8-bit aesthetic and play upon certain events, such as ball collisions and moving objects.

### Gameplay
Each puzzle takes place in a grid format. 
When a “play” button is pressed, a ball will be launched from the start tile of the grid. 
The ball continues moving in a straight line until otherwise interrupted by another object. 
The puzzle will be considered completed when the ball passes over the goal tile. 
The player can manipulate three types of objects to guide the ball into the goal: bumpers, blocks, and spike blocks. 
When the ball hits a block, the ball will bounce back and continue in the opposite direction. 
Upon hitting a bumper, the ball will bounce off the bumper, now moving in whatever direction the bumper was facing. 
The ball will bounce off the side of a bumper that is not sloped (see Figure 1). 
The ball will “pop” upon hitting a wall or spike block.

### Controls
Objects are controlled by buttons that are laid over each interactable block and bumper. 
The buttons will be operated by mouse click. All objects can be moved, but only bumpers can be rotated. 
Arrow buttons will indicate how a block or bumper can be manipulated. 
Move buttons will move the object in the direction of the arrow one tile, unless blocked by another object. 
Moving an object into the tile the ball currently occupies will push the ball, causing it to travel in the direction it was pushed. 
If the sloped side of a bumper is pushed into the ball, the ball will move in the direction of the curve, while remaining in the same tile. (See Figure 2) 
Rotate buttons will rotate the object 90 degrees in the direction of the arrow button. 
Blue colored objects can be manipulated before the object is released but are locked into place after the ball is released. 
Yellow colored objects cannot be manipulated until after the ball is released. 
Gray objects can be moved both before and after the ball releases.

### Tutorials

The first set of puzzles will teach players the basics of play. 
A popup in the backdrop of the grid will display an instruction about a single game mechanic during a puzzle. 
Subsequent puzzles will utilize the same object or control so that the player can practice the mechanic and gain an understanding
on how it works. This pattern will continue until all object types and controls are explained.

### Player Learning
One of the big things the player will have to learn is dealing with objects that can only be moved while the ball is not in play. 
For example, a solid block might be moved to the side so that the player has more room to maneuver other blocks. 
Another skill players will have to develop is deciding when to push the ball with a block or the slope of a bumper. 
For example, a puzzle may not give you enough space to put a block to the side of a moving ball, 
so players would need to use the slope of the bumper to conserve space. Players will also need to develop a decision making tree
in order to solve the puzzles. Potential solutions might start with positioning the objects that cannot be moved while the ball is 
in play, and from there the player must maneuver the other objects. This is just one approach a player might take to
solving a puzzle in Deflect.
